Try to write out specifically what happens in the simulation

// Each Round
# 1. Group any wrestlers in the match into a conflict

Grouping is the process of selecting all the conflicts that happen in and out of the ring

Grouping examples that could become requirements

  - Previous Conflicts try to stay together ()
  - Two wrestlers in the ring (one on one match)
  - Royal Rumble style could have multiple groupings of wrestlers in the ring
  - Two wrestlers one in the ring and one on the outskirts (planning to do some move where you jump over the ropes)
  - 2 on one in the ring (like a tag team match)

# 2. Determing the lead for each conflict
The lead is the wrestlers who is determining the move and trying to cause damage.  Some rules to help determine the lead

  - If a wrestlers is stunned from a previous move.
  - If a wrestler is caught off guard. 
  - 2 on one (one of the two)

# 3. The lead determines the move they will execute
Determining a move should start with making a list of all the available moves to the wrestler.  

These will include moves
  1. Get a list of moves that match their style and traits
  2. Add to that a list of moves that match the current situation (this can be cage match things or like ladder match)
  3. Add in story driver moves (more supernaturally based moves like sending someone to hell)
  3. Filtered out impossible moves (cant grab a weapon while in the ring, cant jump from the top rop while outside the ring)
  4. Then moves will be ranked by traits and goals 
		- If a wrestler wants to humiliate then those moves get higher ranking
		- If a wrestler thinks they can win they will rank pinning higher
		- If they hate their opponent then they might try to injure them.
  5. Finally a move is chosen at random with percentages determined by the ranking above

# 4. For each conflict the lead executes a move.
Move resolution is based on the wrestler, his opponent, the move and the current state of the match (tired, gore stuff like that)

Resolutions can include 

  - success : where the move is executed to some effect
  - reversal: where the lead is changed for the next conflict
	- knocking out the ref

# 5. After all conflicts have resolved we clean up and start another round
Cleanup involves clearing up temporary stats and altering wrestler stats
